desc: If "Advanced Dark" is not in the Field Zone, send this monster to the GY. Your
  "Advanced Crystal Beast" monsters can attack directly, but when they do so using
  this effect, the battle damage inflicted to your opponent is halved. If this face-up
  card is destroyed in a Monster Zone, you can place it face-up in your Spell & Trap
  Zone as a Continuous Spell, instead of sending it to the GY.
